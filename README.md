## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of Recycler is to correctly sort the rubbish into the corresponding recycling bins and strategically use the recycle logos to clear occupied neighboring bins.

2. **Game Interface**: The game interface consists of a grid of recycling bins on the left side and three rubbish/recycle logos displayed on the right side of the screen.

3. **Sorting Rubbish**: Rubbish items will appear at the top of the screen, and players must drag and drop them into the correct recycling bins. Each rubbish item corresponds to a specific bin, such as paper, plastic, or aluminium cans.

4. **Clearing Neighboring Bins**: To clear occupied neighboring bins, players can use the recycle logos provided on the right side of the screen. By strategically placing the recycle logo, players can remove multiple adjacent bins simultaneously.

5. **Scoring**: The score in Recycler is based on the number of bins cleared at once. The score increases exponentially as players successfully erase more bins simultaneously. This encourages players to think strategically and aim for high scores.

6. **Game Over**: The game continues until time is up.
